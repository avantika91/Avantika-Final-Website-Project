  <P style="color:black;"><b>Rajasthan is a state in northern India. It covers 342,239 square kilometres (132,139 sq mi)
      or 10.4 per cent of India's total geographical area. It is the largest Indian state by area and the seventh
      largest by population. It is on India's northwestern side, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable
      Thar Desert (also known as the Great Indian Desert) and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to
      the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus River valley. It is bordered by five other Indian
      states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and
      Gujarat to the southwest. Its geographical location is 23.3 to 30.12 North latitude and 69.30 to 78.17 East
      longitude, with the Tropic of Cancer passing through its southernmost tip.

      Its major features include the ruins of the Indus Valley Civilisation at Kalibangan and Balathal, the Dilwara
      Temples, a Jain pilgrimage site at Rajasthan's only hill station, Mount Abu, in the ancient Aravalli mountain
      range and eastern Rajasthan, the Keoladeo National Park of Bharatpur, a World Heritage Site[12] known for its bird
      life. Rajasthan is also home to three national tiger reserves, the Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur,
      Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar and the Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve in Kota.

      The state was formed on 30 March 1949 when Rajputana - the name adopted by the British Raj for its dependencies in
      the region - was merged into the Dominion of India. Its capital and largest city is Jaipur. Other important cities
      are Jodhpur, Kota, Bikaner, Ajmer, Bharatpur and Udaipur. The economy of Rajasthan is the seventh-largest state
      economy in India with ₹10.20 lakh crore (US$130 billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of
      ₹118,000 (US$1,500).</b></P>
